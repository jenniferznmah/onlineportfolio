	<h1 class="display-1">About Jennifer Mah</h1>
	
	<h2 class="text-info"><em>I recently launched my career in IT by working as a <span class="text-danger">Web Designer/Junior Web Administrator</span> at Globe FC. I helped redesign the company website and I worked for eight weeks. It was my first full-time position and it was a position in a field that I was interested in. I enjoyed working there very much. I learned a lot within those eight weeks and built a network with the people I worked with.</em></h2>

	<h2><span class=text-primary><a href="https://globefc.ca/">Link to Globe FC website that I worked on</a></span></h2>

	<h2 class="text-info"><em>Now I am applying for <span class="text-success">Web Designer and Web Developer postings (Junior of course) and searching for a full-time permanent position</span> to gain more real-world experience, grow professionally, build my confidence, and add to my career portfolio.</em></h2>
	
	<h2 class="text-primary"><em>Somewhere down this career path I have chosen I would like to take a couple of online courses for professional development.</em></h2> 

	<h2 class="text-info"><em>I have a <span class=
	"text-success">Certificate from the Introduction to Coding Boot Camp course</span> that I took through Industry-Education Council of Hamilton and City School by Mohawk College and previous to that, I took a Web Design course in the process of obtaining my Diploma from the Office Administration - Medical program at Mohawk College.</em></h2>
