	<h1 class="display-1">About Jennifer Mah</h1>
	
	<h2 class="text-info"><em>I secured my first full-time seasonal role in Web Design and Development by working as a <span class="text-danger">Web Designer/Junior Web Administrator</span> at Globe FC. I helped redesign the company website and I worked for eight weeks. I enjoyed working there very much. I learned a lot within those eight weeks and built a network with the people I worked with. I held this role from July 2020 to September 2020. </em></h2>

	<h2><span class=text-primary><a href="https://globefc.ca/">Link to Globe FC website that I worked on</a></span></h2>

	<h2 class="text-info"><em>Now I am applying for <span class="text-success">Web Designer and Web Developer postings (Junior to start) and searching for a full-time permanent role</span> to gain more real-world experience, grow professionally, build my confidence, and add to my career portfolio.</em></h2>
	
	<h2 class="text-primary"><em>Somewhere down this career path I have chosen I would like to take a couple of online courses for professional development via Coursera.</em></h2> 

	<h2 class="text-info"><em>I obtained a certificate from the Introduction to Coding Boot Camp course that I enrolled in via Industry-Education Council of Hamilton and Mohawk College City School. I was also enrolled in a web design course when I was a full-time student in the Office Administration - Medical program at Mohawk College.</em></h2>
