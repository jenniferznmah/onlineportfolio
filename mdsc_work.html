	<h1>Volunteer Work at Mood Disorders Society of Canada</h1>
	<p><i>I volunteered as a Website Auditor at Mood Disorders Society of Canada from February 2021 to April 2021. I worked on the <a href="https://mdsc.ca/">Mood Disorders Society of Canada</a> English website and the <a href="https://www.defeatdepression.ca/">Defeat Depression</a> campaign website.</i></p>
	<p><i>My role was to review and edit the websites for grammar and spelling errors and broken hyperlinks. I also checked the website for responsiveness issues and made recommendations to improve the website flow. I did other duties as assigned. Everything was reported to the National Program Manager.</i></p>
